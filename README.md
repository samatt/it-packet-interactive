##Packet Interactive

Plan is to use node-pcap to parse packets and then display 
based on [this prototype](https://kaganjd.github.io/packet-sketches/v2/) by [Jen](https://github.com/kaganjd)

##Development

1. Fork and clone this repo
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Run `npm start` to start the server. This also runs nodemon so the server automatically updates with any changes you make.


Things to keep in mind
